                        Umatilla County, established in 1862, has an area of 3,231 square miles (Umatilla County
                        History 2009) and approximately 2,057,767 acres. Seventy percent of the land or 1,447,321 acres
                        is divided among 1,658 farms (2007 Census of Agriculture). There are 804,065 acres of total
                        cropland (Ibid.) with 357,529 (OAIN 2009) acres harvested and the products sold in 2008. The
                        rest of the land was left fallow, grazed, or enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program. In
                        2008, Umatilla County at $378,961,000 had the second highest agricultural sales among the 36
                        Oregon counties, behind Marion County (Ibid.). Umatilla/Hermiston
                        and Milton-Freewater primarily produce irrigated agricultural crops. Umatilla/Hermiston
                        produces more than ninety percent of the Field Crops (potatoes, mint, etc.) and Grasses and
                        Legumes in the County. Milton-Freewater produces more than ninety percent of the Tree Fruit
                        and Nuts in the County. Pilot Rock/Pendleton has the highest sales of Grains (44.71%) and
                        Livestock (43.55%) in the County.
                        crops (e.g. potatoes, green peas, asparagus, melons), hay and silage feeds (e.g. alfalfa, corn, pea
                        vines), fruit products (e.g. apples, cherries, prunes, peaches, apricots, grapes), and an extensive
                        livestock industry raising cattle and calves, hogs and pigs, sheep and lambs, and chickens and
                        turkeys. Besides being the largest industry in this county and second largest industry in Oregon,
                        agriculture creates a rural atmosphere greatly desired by many city, rural, and regional people. A
                        comprehensive plan considers agriculture as an irreplaceable natural resource. Its wise use is of
                        as much importance as other resources.

                        dams on this river. McNary Dam is among the biggest dams on this river. The dam is 7,365 feet
                        long, rising approximately 183 feet above the streambed. It consists of a concrete structure with
                        an earth fill embankment at the Oregon (south) abutment. The spillway is a concrete, gravity-
                        type spillway dam. It is 1,310 feet long, and contains 22 vertical lift gates, each 50 feet by 51
                        feet. The crest is at elevation 291 feet mean sea level and is designed to pass a flood of 2,200,000

                        Hermiston Generating Plant (HGP) is located in northeastern Oregon, nine miles south of the
                        Columbia River. HGP is a 474 megawatt highly reliable modern natural gas fueled power plant
                        that provides power for nearly 500,000 households in the Pacific Northwest. The plant also
                        provides steam to Lamb-Weston&#39;s adjacent potato processing plant. HGP was built by Bechtel
                        for U.S. Generating Company in 1996. The plant is based on two General Electric Frame 7FA
                        combustion turbine generators operating in combined-cycle with two heat recovery steam
                        generators and two steam turbine generators. Perennial owns 50 percent interest in HGP and is
                        the plant&#39;s manager and operator. HGP has been recognized by the Oregon Occupational Safety
                        and Health Division (OR-OSHA) for the plant&#39;s exceptional health and safety record.</p>

                        The Hermiston Power Project is another power plant with capacity of 546 MW located in
                        Hermiston, Oregon. The plant utilizes two combustion turbines, each with its own heat recovery
                        steam generator, that supplies steam to a single steam turbine generator. The Hermiston Power
                        Project sells a portion of the power it produces into the Pacific Northwest and California power
                        markets as part of Calpine’s Western region of power plants. Calpine also leverages the plant’s
                        quick-responding, natural-gas fired generation and its contracted transmission resources in the
                        Northwest to help integrate wind energy into the region’s power grid. Through agreements with
                        the Constellation Energy Balancing Authority, Hermiston’s output is quickly increased or
                        reduced to compensate for the variability of wind generation. Fueled by natural gas and equipped
                        with advanced emissions control technology, the Hermiston Power Project is one of the cleanest
                        projects of its kind in the state. In 2003, the Hermiston Chamber of Commerce nominated
                        Calpine for the Governor’s Gold Award based on its community support activities.</p>

                        Water resources in the Umatilla sub basin include surface water, ground water and waste water.
                        Surface water is derived from Columbia River and its tributaries such as Umatilla River, ponds
                        and water reservoirs. Groundwater is an important resource to the economy of Umatilla County
                        by providing the bulk of the water used for agriculture, as well as for drinking water supplies for
                        the many communities and nearly all of the rural residences. The Umatilla Basin has more
                        groundwater resource areas determined to be “Critical” by the Oregon Water Resources
                        Department than any other part of Oregon. Waste water is coming from residential areas and
                        food processing industries.
                        According to Mucken and Bateman (2017) report, quality of surface water and ground water is
                        critical for residential, agricultural and industrial use and being monitored by Oregon
                        Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ).
