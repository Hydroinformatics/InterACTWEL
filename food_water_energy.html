                            Umatilla County, established in 1862, has an area of 3,231 square miles (Umatilla County
                            History 2009) and approximately 2,057,767 acres. Seventy percent of the land or 1,447,321 acres
                            is divided among 1,658 farms (2007 Census of Agriculture). There are 804,065 acres of total
                            cropland (Ibid.) with 357,529 (OAIN 2009) acres harvested and the products sold in 2008. The
                            rest of the land was left fallow, grazed, or enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program. In
                            2008, Umatilla County at $378,961,000 had the second highest agricultural sales among the 36
                            Oregon counties, behind Marion County (Ibid.). As can be seen in Figure 2. Umatilla/Hermiston
                            and Milton-Freewater primarily produce irrigated agricultural crops. Umatilla/Hermiston
                            produces more than ninety percent of the Field Crops (potatoes, mint, etc.) and Grasses and
                            Legumes in the County. Milton-Freewater produces more than ninety percent of the Tree Fruit
                            and Nuts in the County. Pilot Rock/Pendleton has the highest sales of Grains (44.71%) and
                            Livestock (43.55%) in the County.
                            crops (e.g. potatoes, green peas, asparagus, melons), hay and silage feeds (e.g. alfalfa, corn, pea
                            vines), fruit products (e.g. apples, cherries, prunes, peaches, apricots, grapes), and an extensive
                            livestock industry raising cattle and calves, hogs and pigs, sheep and lambs, and chickens and
                            turkeys. Besides being the largest industry in this county and second largest industry in Oregon,
                            agriculture creates a rural atmosphere greatly desired by many city, rural, and regional people. A
                            comprehensive plan considers agriculture as an irreplaceable natural resource. Its wise use is of
                            as much importance as other resources.

                        Temperature, sedimentation, and nutrients are the most common types of pollution that impair
                        Oregon’s rivers and streams. Impaired water quality drives up the cost of water treatment and
                        limits access to clean water for fish, drinking water, agriculture, and recreation.

                        Groundwater contamination is also a serious issue in some areas of Oregon. Private domestic
                        wells may face contamination issues from nearby failing septic systems. Industry and agriculture
                        can also be a source of pollutants for groundwater, as can surface water and groundwater
                        interactions.
                        Most of DEQ’s groundwater monitoring efforts target vulnerable areas or areas of known
                        contamination (i.e., Groundwater Management Areas (GWMAs)). Nitrate is one of the most
                        commonly analyzed contaminants in these areas, with data showing that around 30 percent of
                        groundwater samples detect nitrate at levels that suggest a 22 Chapter 1 – Understand Water
                        Resources Today pollution problem exists (7 mg/L), and around 20 percent currently exceed
                        health standards (10 mg/L). Bacteria are a commonly detected contaminant as well, with about
                        20 percent of samples showing positive bacteria detections. Arsenic is not as commonly studied,
                        but when sampled in vulnerable groundwater areas, about 30 percent of samples show levels
                        above health standards (10 ug/L). Other contaminants detected in groundwater studies include
                        Dacthal, manganese, lead, iron, aluminum, perchlorate, uranium and vanadium. There have been
                        few studies that investigate contaminants such as current use and legacy pesticides, herbicides,
                        pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and volatile organic compounds. Based on data
                        collected in the past five years, when detections of those contaminants are found, they are often
                        far below health standards, if any standards exist.

                            Hermiston Generating Plant (HGP) is located in northeastern Oregon, nine miles south of the
                            Columbia River. HGP is a 474 megawatt highly reliable modern natural gas fueled power plant
                            that provides power for nearly 500,000 households in the Pacific Northwest. The plant also
                            provides steam to Lamb-Weston&#39;s adjacent potato processing plant. HGP was built by Bechtel
                            for U.S. Generating Company in 1996. The plant is based on two General Electric Frame 7FA
                            combustion turbine generators operating in combined-cycle with two heat recovery steam
                            generators and two steam turbine generators. Perennial owns 50 percent interest in HGP and is
                            the plant&#39;s manager and operator. HGP has been recognized by the Oregon Occupational Safety

                            The Hermiston Power Project is another power plant with capacity of 546 MW located in
                            Hermiston, Oregon. The plant utilizes two combustion turbines, each with its own heat recovery
                            steam generator, that supplies steam to a single steam turbine generator. The Hermiston Power
                            Project sells a portion of the power it produces into the Pacific Northwest and California power
                            markets as part of Calpine’s Western region of power plants. Calpine also leverages the plant’s

                            Northwest to help integrate wind energy into the region’s power grid. Through agreements with
                            the Constellation Energy Balancing Authority, Hermiston’s output is quickly increased or
                            reduced to compensate for the variability of wind generation. Fueled by natural gas and equipped

                                 (Interactive Adaptation and Collaboration Tool for managing Water, Energy and Land)
                                 InterACTWEL is a computer-aided decision support tool that is being developed to empower land, water,
                                 energy managers and food producers to envision and plan towards a resilient future for their local communities.
                                 Unlike other tools that focus on the short-term decision-making, InterACTWEL will help communities identify
                                 decisions for long-term adaptation to changes that they do not have control of, such as a severe water restriction
                                 or changing state laws.
                                 To make this tool successful, we need to hear from water, energy managers, and food producers about their
                                 current and future management concerns and the types of information needed to make more informed management
                                 decisions and long-term plans.
                                 Because natural resources are limited, many communities need assistance to effectively coordinate demand,
                                 allocation and efficient use of water, energy and land. Coordination among stakeholders is especially critical
                                 when resource availability and quality is threatened. Stakeholders may include those whose livelihoods depend
                                 on food and energy production, as well as availability of water for consumptive uses (e.g., industry, agriculture,
                                 drinking water) as well as non-consumptive uses (e.g., fisheries, ecosystem maintenance, recreation, navigation,
                                 hydropower, cultural preservation). Food-Energy-Water (FEW) actors often include farmers, tribes, water managers,
                                 dam operators, industries, recreationalists, government agencies and environmentalists. InterACTWEL is a
                                 computer-aided decision support tool that empowers FEW actors to envision and plan towards a resilient future
                                 for their local communities. Unlike other tools that focus on the short-term decision-making, InterACTWEL in
                                 a long-term planning tool that help communities be more resilient to changes that they do not have control of,
                                 such as a severe water restriction or changing state laws. Whenever there is an environmental disturbance (e.g.,
                                 extreme floods, droughts, groundwater declines, fish diseases) or when there are new agricultural or
                                 environmental policies, FEW actors can use InterACTWELs intuitive interfaces to examine how these factors
                                 will affect their goals, operations and livelihoods. The scientific models in InterACTWEL allow individual
                                 actors to identify potential adaptation strategies from a wide range of management choices available to them,
                                 while also enabling them to learn about how their decisions affect other FEW actors. With InterACTWEL local
                                 communities of FEW actors can increase their overall capacity to adjust their operations through time, for
                                 uncertain and adverse stresses affecting the environment or the economy. Anyone can use and access InterACTWEL;
                                 the data-secure tool is easy to navigate and can run on either a desktop or mobile application. How it works:
                                 InterACTWEL goes well beyond just being a web-based platform to share data and information among FEW actors in
                                 a local region. The system contains advanced scientific models and interactive optimization algorithms that can
                                 quickly synthesize and leverage the collective wisdom of FEW actors. The algorithms help identify potential
                                 adaptation strategies, while also meeting environmental, economic and social sustainability goals. InterACTWEL
                                 allows FEW actors to upload and connect their own trusted scientific models such as hydrologic, economic or crop
                                 growth models for analyses of their sector. If a FEW actors model is overly complex, then users can upload
                                 results from their own simulation models via a graphical user interface. The machine-learning algorithms
                                 in InterACTWEL will then create fast surrogate models to represent the FEW actors system in the adaptation
                                 planning framework. InterACTWEL is highly flexible. It allows individuals and groups to modify the decisions
                                 proposed by the optimization algorithms while also accepting new information at any time. If FEW actors are
                                 unsatisfied with the scenarios for water and natural resource use that InterACTWEL provides, then they can
                                 modify the scenarios, and the tool will adapt to the new preferences. All of this is accomplished in a secure
                                 and trusted cyber environment. If a FEW actor is considering a potential strategy, it can be kept private and
                                 not shared with other users. InterACTWEL is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute
                                 of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) via an interagency partnership between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and
                                 USDA-NIFA.

                                Water resources in the Umatilla sub basin include surface water, ground water and waste water.
                                Surface water is derived from Columbia River and its tributaries such as Umatilla River, ponds
                                and water reservoirs. Groundwater is an important resource to the economy of Umatilla County
                                by providing the bulk of the water used for agriculture, as well as for drinking water supplies for
                                the many communities and nearly all of the rural residences. The Umatilla Basin has more

                                Department than any other part of Oregon. Waste water is coming from residential areas and
                                food processing industries.
                                According to Mucken and Bateman (2017) report, quality of surface water and ground water is
                                critical for residential, agricultural and industrial use and being monitored by Oregon

                            limits access to clean water for fish, drinking water, agriculture, and recreation.

                            Groundwater contamination is also a serious issue in some areas of Oregon. Private domestic
                            wells may face contamination issues from nearby failing septic systems. Industry and agriculture
                            can also be a source of pollutants for groundwater, as can surface water and groundwater
                            interactions.</p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                            Most of DEQ’s groundwater monitoring efforts target vulnerable areas or areas of known
                            contamination (i.e., Groundwater Management Areas (GWMAs)). Nitrate is one of the most
                            commonly analyzed contaminants in these areas, with data showing that around 30 percent of
                            groundwater samples detect nitrate at levels that suggest a 22 Chapter 1 – Understand Water
                            Resources Today pollution problem exists (7 mg/L), and around 20 percent currently exceed
                            health standards (10 mg/L). Bacteria are a commonly detected contaminant as well, with about
                            20 percent of samples showing positive bacteria detections. Arsenic is not as commonly studied,
                            but when sampled in vulnerable groundwater areas, about 30 percent of samples show levels
                            above health standards (10 ug/L). Other contaminants detected in groundwater studies include
                            Dacthal, manganese, lead, iron, aluminum, perchlorate, uranium and vanadium. There have been
                            few studies that investigate contaminants such as current use and legacy pesticides, herbicides,
                            pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and volatile organic compounds. Based on data
                            collected in the past five years, when detections of those contaminants are found, they are often
                            far below health standards, if any standards exist.
