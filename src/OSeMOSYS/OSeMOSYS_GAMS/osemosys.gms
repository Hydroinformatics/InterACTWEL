* OSEMOSYS 2011.07.07 conversion to GAMS by Ken Noble, Noble-Soft Systems - August 2012
*
* Files required are:
* osemosys.gms (this file)
* osemosys_dec.gms
* utopia_data.txt
* osemosys_equ.gms
*
* To run this GAMS version of OSeMOSYS on your PC:
* 1. YOU MUST HAVE GAMS VERSION 22.7 OR HIGHER INSTALLED.
* This is because OSeMOSYS has some parameter, variable and equation names
* that exceed 31 characters in length, and GAMS versions prior to 22.7 have
* a limit of 31 characters on the length of such names.
* 2. Ensure that your PATH contains the GAMS Home Folder.
* 3. Place all 4 of the above files in a convenient folder,
* open a Command Prompt window in this folder, and enter:
* gams osemosys.gms
* 4. You should find that you get an optimal value of 26630.2254.
* 5. Some results are created in file SelResults.CSV that you can view in Excel.
